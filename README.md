This is the repo for a practice challenge that is below.

To run the unit tests:

`python -m unittest test_fizz_buzz`

To use the module:

`from fizzbuzz import fizz_buzz_output, fizz_buzz_print_list`

For individual numbers:

`fizz_buzz_output`

For a printed list of numbers:

`fizz_buzz_print_list`
